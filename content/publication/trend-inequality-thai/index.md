abstract: Trend on Inequality and Well-Being of Thai Households This paper investigates inequality trend between 1988 and 2017 in multidimensional aspects using the Thailand Socio-Economic Survey (SES). Rather than limiting the study to income inequality, this paper also includes inequality in health, education, durable goods, financial assets and technology. There are two approaches for inequality this measures. First, we analyze each dimension individually. The second approach, a single measure that aggregates every dimensions are produced. Over the period of study, total income inequality tends to decrease. However, income inequality increases in 2017. Using average number of years of education by family members ages 14 and older, educational inequality is quite stable. In health aspect, we calculated the expected health benefit from household characteristics and found that the inequality of expected health benefit decrease over the period. For financial assets and technology, inequality measures slightly decrease since 2006 but inequalities in both aspects increase in last four years of our data. Comparing every dimensions, financial assets and technology are distributed worse than household income. While, educational and health measure are distributed better than income. In term of multidimensional index, the single index shows that the inequality is better over period between 2006 and 2013. However, the inequality trend is reversed in year 2013.
